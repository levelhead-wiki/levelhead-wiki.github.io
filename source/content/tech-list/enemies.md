While mid-air, throw the flapsack downwards. The flapsack will bounce off the ground allowing GR-18 to perform a Flapsack Super Jump. This can be useful for traversing surfaces that would kill GR-18 and bounce a flapsack.

Start 1 to 2 tiles away from a wall. When approaching the peak of the jump, throw the Squished Scrubb against the wall. It will bounce back to GR-18, which can then be jumped off of.
