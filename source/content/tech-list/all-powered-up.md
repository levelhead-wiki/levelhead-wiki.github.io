The tech you can perform with the various powerups in LevelHead.

## Rebound
### Rebound Super Jump
With GR-18’s back against a wall, perform a [Super Jump](https://levelhead.wiki/tech-list/you-and-the-goods/#super-jump). At the peak of the Super Jump, throw the package upwards again. Immediately rebound blast twice. Grab and jump off the package as GR-18 passes up through it. Without a wall, a more precise timing of rebound blast in one direction and then the other can be used. This allows GR-18 to reach a height of **17** tiles.

### Infinity Rebound Leap
Jump forward. Make a rebound blast to extend the jump. Throw the package in the direction of the momentum. Make another rebound blast to extend the jump to align with the falling package. Super jump off the package. This can be done repeatedly to allow **infinite** horizontal travel.

### Rebound ISJ _(Rebound Infinite Super Jump)_
Jump from the ground. Just before the peak of the jump, throw the package up-diagonally. As GR-18 starts falling, perform a rebound blast to align with the falling package. Jump off and grab the package. Immediately do another diagonal throw to repeat the process. This can be done infinitely to reach **infinite** heights.


## Ripcord
### Enemy Rocket Launch
Immediately after bouncing off an enemy, hold jump to initiate a rocket jump. The momentum from bouncing off the enemy is carried through to the rocket launch, allowing GR-18 to reach a height of **21** tiles.

### Power Launch _(AKA Ripcord Quick-Take-Off)_
While standing on the ground, press jump once to jump and a second time to initiate the rocket. The momentum of the initial jump will carry into the rocket allowing for additional height gain. This technique allows clearing heights of **18** tiles.

### Air Refuel _(AKA Ripcord Easy Infinite Super Jump, Refuel)_
When GR-18 runs out of fuel, throw the package upwards and begin hovering. As the package falls through GR-18’s feet, jump and grab the package. This will refuel GR-18’s Ripcord. This can be done **infinitely**. To increase the jump window, throw the package sooner so that the package is contacted higher in its arc. This can also be performed diagonally.

### Ripcord ISJ _(AKA Ripcord Fast Infinite Super Jump)_
Rocket upwards. Before running out of fuel, throw the package upwards. Jump off and grab the package mid-air as it descends. This resets the fuel and can repeated **infinitely**. This can also be performed diagonally.

This tech differs from [Air Refuel](#air-refuel) in that instead of throwing the package up after running out of fuel and are hovering, you instead throw the package up while going up. This makes Ripcord ISJ faster traveling than Air Refuel while at the same time being a harder tech.

## Tiptow
### Tow Slide _(AKA Tiptow Slide Up)_
When contacting a wall with vertical momentum from a jump, hold jump to retain that momentum up against the wall. This allows slipping past **1** tile width gaps by pressing against the wall. This technique does not seem to work from non-jumping momentum sources (e.g. Sky Wigglers). From a regular jump this technique can be used between walls to bypass an up to **3** tile high spiketron wall.

### Bush Slide
After contacting a wall and beginning the slide animation, use Tiptow’s special ability to turn into a bush while still sliding on the wall. This tech will not work if GR-18 turns into a bush before touching the wall.

### Rising Coyote Wall Jump
When using Tiptow and after sliding upwards past the edge of a wall, press jump. GR-18 will wall jump off the open space. A Rising Coyote Wall Jump will allow GR-18 to reach a jump of **5** tiles high. 

### Descending Coyote Wall Jump
When using Tiptow and after sliding downwards past the edge of a wall, press jump.  GR-18 will wall jump off the open space. A Descending Coyote Wall Jump will allow GR-18 to cling to a ceiling level with the end of the wall up to two tiles away.

### Disposable Corner-Up
Wall-hang past the edge of a ceiling. Throw down an item to boost up. Move back towards the wall to begin a wall climb.

### Infinite Ceiling Hold
While clinging to a ceiling, throw a box up and then jump off it as it falls below GR-18. This allows GR-18 to **infinitely** cling to a ceiling.

### Climbing Super Jump
Jump off and back to the wall. Just before landing, throw the package diagonally up and away from the wall. Jump off the wall to land on the package mid-air. Jump off and grab the package.

### Disposable Underhang
Immediately after wall-sliding past the lower edge of a wall, throw an object down and hold jump. GR-18 will cling to the overhang.

### Deliverable Corner-Up
While approaching an upwards corner from a hang, throw the package up and forward. Let go of the hang to land on the box mid-air. Jump off the package and grab it to engage the wall for a wall climb.

### Perfectly Verticle Infinite Climb
While near a wall, jump and throw the package forward at a wall while ascending. Once the peak of the jump is reached, cling to the wall for a short moment, and then immediately let go of the wall and land on the box. Now, a normal super jump can be performed. This can be repeated infinitely. 

## Waylay
### Flying Waylay _(AKA Discount Ripcord)_
When holding a Blopsack, repeatedly aerial punc to gain infinite horizontal and verticle movement.

Tech Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRzSM-gn04

### Charge Block
Punch a bullet to destroy it without dying.

### Traversal Charge
Punch while on the ground to avoid contacting hazards on the same level. GR-18 still needs to land on a standable block. This can traverse **6** tiles of hazards.

### Sprint Dash
Punch while on the ground and having sprint to gain **super-speeb** and increase punch distance to **12** tiles. This can be combined with [Traversal Charge](#traversal-charge) to go over **12** tiles of hazards.

### Fortified Dash
While equiped with either an armor plate or reusable armor, punch immediately after taking damage. This allows GR-18 to move through semi-solid hazards.

### Bounceless Smash
Punch a wall, brick, or brittle rock at a distance of **6** tiles to prevent the knockback from the punch contacting an item.

### Waylay Nullifier Blast
Punch through a a power-up purge gate or a different power-up pickup to gain **ultra-super-speeb** and cover great distances. Removing the Waylay mid-punch keeps the speed from the punch while removing the decelleration the game normally applies.

### Waylay Fade Away
Perform a diagonal arial charge into a wall. GR-18 will bounce back to **3** tiles from the contact point. Combined with holding the opposite direction, GR-18 can bounce back **8** tiles. This can be used to access gaps up to **9** tiles high.

### Floating Wall Punch _(AKA Waylay Coyote Punch)_
Stand beside a wall, dash into it and press jump as GR-18 rises from the rebound. GR-18 will perform a coyote jump off the rebound. Even though you "stood" beside the wall, GR-18 can jump as high as if you were sprinting (**5** tiles)! This can be performed from afar, however a closer start makes the jump timing easier.

### Infinity Waylay Leap
Jump forward. When GR-18 starts falling, throw the package forward. Then dash diagonally to the package, to then jump off of it and re-grab it. This can be done repeatedly to allow **infinite** horizontal travel.

### Waylay ISJ
While moving upwards from a jump, throw the package in an upwards diagonal. Air punch towards the package and perform a super jump. Repeat. This allows GR-18 to reach **infinite** heights.

### Flat Air Dash
Throw a package upwards. Jump so that GR-18 passes through the package as it is descending. Press dash as GR-18’s toes touch the top of the package. GR-18 will make a horizontal dash. This is **frame perfect**. The package can be regrabbed.

## Zipper
### Fractured Sprint
Zip through obstacles or over gaps while gaining sprint to retain accumulated ‘wind up’ time. The count up to gain sprint does not reset from a zip.

### Zip-Up
Zip while jumping or having any upwards momentum to continue the upwards momentum after the zip and reach heights beyond walls. This applies to momentum from jumping, bombs, wigglers or any vertical momentum.

### Blasted Zipper Shift
After launching from a blaster, use the Zipper’s zip ability.  GR-18 will continue on the same trajectory of the blaster from the new location.

### Standing Zip-Up _(AKA Zipped Coyote Jump)_
After zipping, a coyote jump can be performed to reach regular jump height after a zip to a location that GR-18 can not stand on. This includes open space and hazards.

### Blip Zip
If a zip is buffered during a respawn at a Budd-E the following zip can be shortened around spiketrons. The zip will treat spiketrons like walls due to being invincible from the respawn. A jump can also be buffered with the Blip Zip.

### Zipper ISJ
Jump forward and throw the package forward almost immediately. Once a little bit of height is gained, zip in that same direction. If done correctly, it will be possible to fall on the package and then perform a super jump. This can be repeated an infinite amount of times.

## Shade
**TODO**: Find list of Shade techs. Find or create tech demo levels and videos.

### Rune Jem Grab
The Shade Rune will collect any jems it grabs as it is thrown. This can be used to collect jems through semi-solid hazards like fire. It can also be used to collect jems up to **12** tiles above GR-18.

### Shady Coyote Jump.
Throw the Shade Rune somewhere and then stand on a tile. After teleporting to the Rune a [Coyote Jump](/tech-list/you-and-the-goods#coyote-jump) can be performed to gain an extra **4** tiles of height.

### Rune Hop
The [Item Hop](/tech-list/items#item-hop) can be performed with the Shade Rune.

### Vertical Rune Climb
When next to a wall with a Shade Rune, jump up and spam the throw/grab buttons down and towards the wall. You will slowly gain **infinite** height.
