### Stable Drift
![Stable Drift](/img/environment/StableDrift.gif#floatright)

## Powered Gate

### Gate Jump

## Spiketrons

### Pixel Toe _(AKA Ledge Jumping, One-toe Ledging)_
![Pixel Toe](/img/environment/PixelToe.gif#floatright)
Using the properties of the circular hazard hitbox, it is possible to stand GR-18 on the very edge of a solid block that has a Spiketron above it. This also applies to Spike Traps and Whizblades. This does not apply to 1x scale Cromblers.
