## Any Carryable

### Item Boost _(AKA Kick Boost)_
While in the air, throw any item downwards. This provides GR-18 with an extra tile of height. Any carryable, including those that don’t go down can be used to perform this.

### Item Hop
Item hopping allows GR-18 to traverse a row of Spiketrons using throwable items. While holding down and a lateral direction, repeatedly press grab. GR-18 will alternate throwing the item down and picking the item up. The kick boost from throwing the item down prevents GR-18 from touching the ground. This can be done under a 2 high ceiling. This tech can be done with any carryable.
